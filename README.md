## Disclaimer

I used a local LLM (large language model) to generate the code for the Spotify playlist song randomiser, in the name of `vibe coding`. This was intended to be a personal project and everything worked with minimal changes. You're welcome to change things up if they're suboptimal.

## Demo

You can download this notebook and replace the audio files with your own local files as well as input your own Spotify API credentials.

## Usage

Once you've got your audio files ready and your API credentials in place, click Generate New Set to get a randomised set of kick, snare, and hi-hat sounds along with a track from your randomised Spotify playlists

## Why did I make this

I make beats a lot and I buy/download a lot of drum packs over the years. That means hundreds of drum packs get unused thanks to recency bias. A project like this can help me use drums I would never have used before, as well as shake things up with the samples I use.

## Ideas and improvements

- The code isn't great so feel free to critique it (but please be kind if you do; I'm a self-taught Python coder!)
- I'm also not great with Git so feel free to critique how I set up this repo (again, please be kind!)
- I have been working on having the sounds play a mini loop but I've not included that in this repo.
- I guess you could replace Spotify playlists with YouTube videos or any other streaming platform with an API
